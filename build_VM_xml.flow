##** Gather CPU cores to be used by the VM. Don't include hyper-thread siblings

##** Gather how many CPU cores will be used for emulator threads

##** Gather how many CPU cores will be used for iothreads

##** Match hyper-thread siblings. Remove duplicates

##** Identify hyper-thread siblings for the quantity of cores requested for emulator threads

##** Identify hyper-thread siblings for the quantity of cores requested for iothreads

##** Identify hyper-thread siblings for the quantity of cores remaining for the VM

##** Iterate through emulator thread list to add the pinning option information for the command

##** Iterate through iothread list to add the pinning option information for the command

##** Iterate through the remaining cores list to add the pinning option information for the command

##** Construct the virt-install command, including quantity of vCPUs, memory, and network (NEED TO GATHER NON-CPU DETAILS)
